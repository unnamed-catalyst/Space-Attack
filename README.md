# Space Attack
Quick little game that I made where you play as a spaceship protecting the Earth from oncoming asteroids 

## How To Play
The aim of the game is to protect the Earth from oncoming asteroids for as long as possible. Control the spaceship using either the arrow keys or the "WASD" keys on the keyboard, shoot laser beams to destroy the asteroids using either the left mouse button or the "Left Ctrl" key on the keyboard. Each time an asteroid hits the Earth, it loses some health, and the game is over when the health is down to zero. The final score is the time the player survived.
